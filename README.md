Find partials in your Rails app super easy! :D

Just install this gem, add '_way' to your querystring and all of your partials, when rendered, will have their path appened to them.

Install
-------

```shell
gem install way
```
or add the following line to Gemfile:

```shell
gem 'way'
```

Use
---

1. Add '_way' to the querystring
![add to querystring](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kittypizza/way-toolbar.png)

2. Hit enter and your partials will now display their full path
![preview](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kittypizza/way-preview.png)

and run `bundle install` from your shell.

Supported Rails versions
------------------------

Rails 2.3.x

Rails 3.x

Why?
---

Since I have to work on a LARGE Rails codebase everyday, finding where a
particular partial is can be a little annoying. When having to add or
edit some markup for a partial, spending a few minutes looking around gets
frustrating. This helps save a few extra seconds.

I know the output is a little crude but it still works. :)
