Why?
---

Since I have to work on a LARGE Rails codebase everyday, finding where a
particular partial is can be a little annoying. When having to add or
edit some markup for a partial, spending a few minutes looking around gets
frustrating. This helps save a few extra seconds.

I know the output is a little crude but it still works. :)
